# Incorta React TypeScript Project

## Overview

This is a React application built using TypeScript. It aims to showcase a modular and reusable component architecture, leveraging React's functional components and TypeScript's strong typing. The project is set up with **Create React App** and uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd incorta-react.ts
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will run on http://localhost:3000.

## Technical Approach

React: Functional components with hooks for state and lifecycle management.
TypeScript: Type safety to enhance development experience and reduce runtime errors.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling, providing responsiveness and modularity.
